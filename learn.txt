Day 2

    Constants
    Comments
    Error types
    Builtin functions
    Initializations
    Strings

Day 3

    Composite data structures (arrays and slices)
    Comparison of array and slice
    fmt package indepth (Scanf, Printf, Sprintf)
    builtin | append, len,
    Exercise

Day 4

    Continue map operations.

    Comma, okay idiom

    Structs

    Data parsing for structs using json tags

    Modules and Packages

    Visibility rules for identifiers

    Visibility rules for packages/modules

Day 5

    Writing functions
    Methods tied to a struct. Methods are function implementations for structs.

Day 6

    Blocks: local block, global block, universe block
    Shadowing
    Control flow: if else statements
    For loops in four ways

Day 7 and 8

    Control flow: switch case | normal switch statements and blank switch statements.
    Error handling: error, panic, recover
    Pointers: A-Z of Pointers. | variables, pointers, dereferences.

Day 9

    Continuing Pointers
    Functions with Pointers (constructors)
    Structs and pointers
    Methods and pointers and structs

Day 10

    Interfaces

Day 11

    Error Handling with err
    Errors with errors package
    Logging with log package
        Levels of Logging: ERROR, INFO, FATAL, WARNING, CRITICAL
        Implementation

Day 12

    Problem solving
    bufio and scanners
    log and errors
    fmt and standard IO operations

Day 14

    More problem solving
    os ops for creating files, folders, giving permissions

Day 15

    How to create and use custom packages.
    Practicalization of this.

Day 16
